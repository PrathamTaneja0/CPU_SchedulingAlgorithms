# Test Case 8: Round Robin - Time Quantum Impact
# This test case shows how time quantum size affects performance

# ========================================
# ALGORITHM COMPARISON SUMMARY
# ========================================

# FCFS (First Come First Serve):

# - Selection: Arrival time (first come, first served)
# - Advantages: Simple, fair, no starvation
# - Disadvantages: Poor performance, convoy effect
# - Best for: Batch processing, simple systems
# - Worst for: Interactive systems, mixed job lengths

# SJF Preemptive (SRTF):
# - Type: Preemptive  
# - Selection: Shortest remaining burst time
# - Advantages: Optimal average waiting time, optimal average turnaround time
# - Disadvantages: Starvation, requires burst time knowledge
# - Best for: Batch systems, minimizing waiting time
# - Worst for: Real-time systems, unknown burst times

# Priority Scheduling:
# - Type: Preemptive
# - Selection: Highest priority number first
# - Advantages: Priority-based execution, good for real-time
# - Disadvantages: Starvation, priority inversion
# - Best for: Real-time systems, critical tasks
# - Worst for: General purpose, unknown priorities

# Round Robin:

# - Advantages: Fair, no starvation, predictable
# - Disadvantages: Context switching overhead, quantum dependency
# - Best for: Time-sharing systems, interactive processes
# - Worst for: Batch processing, very short/long jobs
